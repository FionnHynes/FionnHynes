## 📊 About Me

I’m a data analyst with a strong focus on transforming data into meaningful insights. My background in Business Information Systems and experience in cloud environments have equipped me to support projects involving data cleaning, reporting, and visualization.

Most recently at **Avaya**, I worked on a cloud security migration project, where I cleaned and mapped data, organized cloud subscriptions, and built Power BI dashboards to track progress and support decision-making. I also improved internal documentation using Confluence and supported cross-team coordination efforts.
